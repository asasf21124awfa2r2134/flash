Folder - Old.jsfl - inserts selected layers into a folder named 'old'.

group.jsfl - groups any drawing objects (anything that isn't already a group) on selected frame(s).

labelcel.jsfl - labels // delete this script

labelcel2.jsfl - adds text to all keyframes of the current layer. Uses the layer name and frame label (Mark frame.jsfl), useful to quickly label cels.

LayerDown.jsfl - moves down 1 layer.

LayerUp.jsfl - moves up 1 layer.

Lock Layers.jsfl - locks every layer except the currently selected layer.

Merge.jsfl - clears currently selected frames.

NewAnimClip.jsfl - makes copy of the current layer, but inside a symbol. I personally use this to tween cels for previews (test movie).

newLayer.jsfl - creates a new layer using the current layer name as a reference. If it's A, the new layer name would be B, etc.

NextPass.jsfl - creates a layer with white opacity and copies the timing of the current layer to a new layer with blank keyframes (it's the equivalent of lowering the current layers opacity and making a new one to draw on top).

NextPass2.jsfl - same function as NextPass.jsfl. Instead of a layer with white opacity, it sets the current layer to a light outline mode.

optimize.jsfl - 'optimizes' the current selection, reducing the number of vectors/curves.

overlap.jsfl - sets the currently selected stroke to a lighter colour. I use it for something that is underneath, but still needs to be visible for the inbetweeners.

zoom 1.jsfl
zoom 2.jsfl - zooms slight in or out.

Next Cel.jsfl - moves to the next keyframe.

Previous Cel.jsfl - moves to the previous keyframe.


I recommend buying a keypad so you can keybind all these scripts. I use the Razer Tartarus V2.

That's all for now...
